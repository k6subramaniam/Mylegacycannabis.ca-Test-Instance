## Idea 1: "Retro Street Culture" — Urban Cannabis Collective

**Design Movement**: Neo-Brutalist meets Street Art — raw, bold, unapologetic visual language with exposed structure and high-contrast typography. Inspired by streetwear brands and urban dispensary culture.

**Core Principles**:
1. **Bold Asymmetry** — Off-grid layouts, overlapping elements, diagonal cuts
2. **Raw Authenticity** — Exposed borders, thick outlines, visible structure
3. **High Energy** — Saturated color blocks, aggressive typography, movement
4. **Community-First** — Social proof, location pride, neighborhood identity

**Color Philosophy**: Purple as the dominant power color (authority, premium), Orange as the action/energy color (CTAs, highlights, urgency), White as breathing space, Charcoal for grounding text. Each section uses bold color blocking — alternating purple and white backgrounds with orange accents creating visual rhythm.

**Layout Paradigm**: Broken grid with overlapping cards, diagonal section dividers (clip-path), asymmetric hero with text on one side and product collage on the other. Full-bleed color sections. Mobile stacks into bold single-column with large touch targets.

**Signature Elements**:
1. Diagonal clip-path section transitions (angled cuts between sections)
2. Thick 3px borders on cards with slight rotation on hover
3. "Sticker" badges — rotated labels for "24/7", "FREE SHIPPING", "NEW"

**Interaction Philosophy**: Aggressive hover states — cards lift and rotate slightly, buttons pulse on hover, scroll-triggered entrance animations slide elements in from alternating sides.

**Animation**: Elements enter viewport with staggered slide-in from left/right. Cards have a subtle 1-2deg rotation on hover with scale(1.03). Section headings animate with a typewriter/reveal effect. Mobile: reduced motion, focus on smooth scroll and tap feedback.

**Typography System**: 
- Headings: Bungee (Google Font) — bold, uppercase, display. Captures the retro-meets-urban vibe of Vina Sans.
- Body: Roboto — clean, readable, professional.
- Accents: Roboto Mono — for prices, product details, shipping info (monospace feel from shredweed).

## Idea 2: "Premium Dispensary" — Elevated Cannabis Experience

**Design Movement**: Modern Luxury E-Commerce — clean lines, generous whitespace, sophisticated color usage. Think Apple Store meets premium cannabis brand. Elevated but accessible.

**Core Principles**:
1. **Refined Minimalism** — Clean layouts, purposeful whitespace, no clutter
2. **Premium Feel** — Subtle gradients, soft shadows, polished surfaces
3. **Trust & Authority** — Professional typography, structured information hierarchy
4. **Conversion-Focused** — Clear CTAs, streamlined shopping flow, trust signals

**Color Philosophy**: White dominates as the canvas (luxury, clean), Purple used sparingly for headers, navigation, and key UI elements (authority, premium), Orange exclusively for CTAs and action items (urgency, energy). Light gray for card backgrounds creates depth without heaviness. The restraint in color usage signals premium quality.

**Layout Paradigm**: Wide content areas with generous margins. Hero sections use large imagery with overlaid text. Product grids use consistent 3-column (desktop) / 2-column (tablet) / 1-column (mobile) with ample card spacing. Sticky navigation with blur backdrop. Sidebar filters on desktop, bottom sheet on mobile.

**Signature Elements**:
1. Frosted glass navigation bar (backdrop-blur with semi-transparent purple)
2. Gradient accent lines — thin purple-to-orange gradient borders on featured elements
3. Micro-interaction dots — small animated indicators on interactive elements

**Interaction Philosophy**: Smooth, refined transitions. Cards elevate with soft shadow on hover. Page transitions use subtle fade. Buttons have smooth color transitions. Everything feels intentional and polished, never jarring.

**Animation**: Fade-up entrance animations on scroll (subtle, 20px translate). Smooth 300ms transitions on all interactive elements. Loading states use skeleton screens. Mobile: minimal animation, focus on 60fps scroll performance.

**Typography System**:
- Headings: Roboto (700/900 weight) — uppercase, letter-spacing: 0.05em for authority
- Body: Roboto (400) — comfortable reading
- Prices/Data: Roboto Mono — monospace for numerical precision

## Idea 3: "Bold Pop Commerce" — ShredWeed DNA with Legacy Identity

**Design Movement**: Pop-Art E-Commerce — directly channeling shredweed.com's bold, full-width, color-blocked approach but translated into a functional e-commerce experience. Each section is its own bold statement.

**Core Principles**:
1. **Section-as-Statement** — Every section has its own bold background color and personality
2. **Typography-Driven** — Oversized headings command attention, text IS the design
3. **Full-Width Everything** — No contained boxes, edge-to-edge visual impact
4. **Playful but Professional** — Bold enough to stand out, structured enough to convert

**Color Philosophy**: Alternating section backgrounds create visual rhythm — Purple hero → White products → Light Gray features → Orange CTA → Purple footer. Each section is a distinct "room" with its own mood. Orange is the universal action color. Purple sections use white text, white sections use charcoal text.

**Layout Paradigm**: Full-bleed sections stacked vertically. Hero spans entire viewport height on mobile. Product grids use masonry-inspired layout with varying card sizes. Category tiles use a magazine-style mixed grid (1 large + 2 small). Navigation is a full-screen overlay on mobile (purple background, large white text).

**Signature Elements**:
1. Oversized section headings (clamp(2rem, 5vw, 4rem)) with bold uppercase treatment
2. "Pill" shaped buttons and badges — rounded-full with bold colors
3. Wave/curve SVG dividers between sections (replacing sharp edges)

**Interaction Philosophy**: Energetic but controlled. Full-screen mobile menu slides in with staggered text animation. Product cards have a "lift" effect on hover. Add-to-cart buttons have a satisfying scale bounce. Scroll-triggered reveals give a sense of discovery.

**Animation**: Section headings slide up and fade in on scroll. Product cards stagger in (100ms delay between each). Mobile menu items cascade in from left with 50ms stagger. Cart icon bounces when item added. Smooth scroll between sections.

**Typography System**:
- Headings: Bungee Shade or Bungee (Google Font) — maximum impact, uppercase, bold display
- Body: Roboto (400/500) — clean readability
- UI/Labels: Roboto (600) uppercase with letter-spacing for navigation, badges, buttons
